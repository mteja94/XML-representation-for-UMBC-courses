You are asked to develop an XML representation for the UMBC course offerings. Review a sample of computer science courses from the UMBC Fall 2017 schedule for the data that is associated with courses. Specifically 

* design an appropriate XML representation and express it using an XML Schema (not a DTD)
* use your XML representation to encode the data for CMSC 304, 441 and 491 from the Fall 2017 schedule
* develop a simple XSLT transformation to render this as HTML. 

You will find the material in the appendix of the Semantic Web Primer helpful.
